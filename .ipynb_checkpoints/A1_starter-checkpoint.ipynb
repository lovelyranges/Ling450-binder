      " An Abbotsford, B.C. couple that has been waiting nearly two years to bring their newly adopted son home from Africa has learned that the Canadian government is not prepared to grant the child citizenship. \n",
      " Kim and Clark Moran received a letter this week from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada informing them that the federal department has concerns about two-year-old Ayo, whom the couple claims they adopted from an orphanage in Nigeria and gained custody of in August. \n",
      " \"Honestly, it feels like we're living our worst nightmare right now,\" Kim told CTV News Friday. \"The fact that we are being accused right now of an unethical adoption is crazy.\". \n",
      " CTV News has learned that a third party has come forward with an allegation that Ayo's adoption came from a private residence and not an orphanage. \n",
      " \"It does say that in the letter,\" Kim confirmed, adding that \"I have no idea where that information came from because both Clark and I were there in the office with all of the workers from the orphanage.\". \n",
      " Kim would not share a copy of the letter with CTV. \n",
      " In a statement, IRCC did not reveal any details regarding the Ayo's paperwork, but said \"the Government of Canada has obligations under international conventions to ensure children are not abducted, bought or sold, or removed from their biological families without legal consent.\". \n",
      " The department added that \"in some cases, extra steps in the citizenship or immigration process may be needed to make sure the adoption meets all requirements of international adoption.\". \n",
      " The Morans' story first made headlines in October, some three months after they first travelled to Africa to finalize the adoption. \n",
      " According to Kim, the Canadian high commission in Nigeria doesn't have an immigration office, so all adoptions out of that country have to be processed in Ghana. \n",
      " Thinking that the immigration papers that would allow them to bring Ayo back to B.C. wouldn't take more than a few weeks to be finalized, Clark headed back to Canada while Kim and their son remained in Accra. \n",
      " It would be months, however, before the family got an update. \n",
      " Kim was forced to switch places with Clark late last month after her multiple sclerosis flared up. \n",
      " He is now in Ghana with Ayo and she is back in B.C., but it's unclear what the family's future will look like. \n",
      " \"If Canada doesn't grant him citizenship, what happens? They send him back to Nigeria to an orphanage? They take him from us even though he's legally our son?\" Kim said. \n",
      " IRCC has told CTV that under ideal circumstances, the two-step adoption and immigration process can take between six and eight months, but that timeframe can be as long as two years depending on the child's country of origin and other factors. \n",
      " The Morans' paperwork was received in February 2017. A year and 10 months later, the family's adoption process is at the top end of the government's estimated timeline, but has not exceeded it. \n",
      " The Morans have 60 days to respond to the letter, and the IRCC stressed Friday that a final decision on Ayo's citizenship application has not yet been made. \n",
      " Kim said the family is working with an immigration lawyer as well as the adoption agency, whose name she would not reveal, as they weigh their options. \n",

      "When I first walk into his store, a fantastical comic book shop lodged discreetly in Kitchener’s Frederick Mall, I spot him from the corner of my eye, the gracious gatekeeper who invites visitors into a world of fantasy and makes their dreams come true. No, I’m not talking about Ricardo Montalban, who played that rugged emissary of wish-fulfilment, Mr. Roarke, on TV’s Fantasy Island with help from his sidekick, Tattoo. \n",
      " Alfonso Espinos, Andre Campbell, and Alexander Wise inside Studiocomix Press in Frederick Mall, Kitchene. Studiocomix Press is an indie comic-book publisher that will publish anything by anyone. ( Peter Lee / Waterloo Region Record ). \n",
      " I’m talking about Alfonso Espinos, who like Montalban was born in Mexico and made his way to North America to fulfil dreams of a different kind. “We dedicate ourselves solely to independent comic books and local creators,’’ says the 39-year-old founder of Studiocomix Press, which recently celebrated its first birthday. The operation is Waterloo Region’s sole indie comic-book store that is also a printer and publisher — possibly the only one in Canada (or the world). “If you want Marvel, you can go to another comic book shop.”. \n",
      " Article Continued Below. \n",
      " Forget superheroes. They’re represented, but for Espinos — whose store carries works by 200 indie comic-book artists — they’re the tip of the iceberg. “You’re talking about one genre only,” points out the laid-back Cambridge resident, who moved to Canada 15 years ago. “The vast majority of artists do not do superhero comics. There’s sci-fi, horror, children’s, Westerns …” Festooned with colourful indie comics of all styles, genres and levels of expertise, the store is an inspiring tribute to the art of the possible — an escapist retreat with an empowering subtext. “I’m a comic book creator myself,” notes Espinos, who launched his career as a teenager in Mexico and met the now-deceased Marvel guru Stan Lee three times. \n",
      " “I was on the other side 20 years ago. I understand what their needs are.” He’s being modest. To the people who seek his help creating and displaying their art, the ball-capped entrepreneur — whose clients include Mitch Markowitz from The Hilarious House of Frightenstein and the guy who played Joey Jeremiah on Degrassi Junior High — is less publisher than mentor, friend and overseer. \n",
      " Article Continued Below. \n",
      " “Every publisher rejected me,” says Cambridge cartoonist Andre Campbell, whose superhero in Starkeeper uses a wheelchair and is patterned after his own life. “They liked my stories, but not the art. They were looking for the DC Comics style.” Campbell has cerebral palsy, which creates physical challenges that make a computer critical for drawing his distinctive, visually arresting artwork. His universal message of diversity and inclusion? That comes directly from his brain. “In my experience, there hasn’t been a whole lot of representation of disabled characters in comics,” says the bow-tied maverick, noting that his disability doesn’t define who he is. “I wanted to emphasize that no matter who you are you can do anything.” In Espinos, he found a willing accomplice, a guy willing to nurture his vision without judgment. “Before I met Alfonso, I didn’t really have a lot of faith in the industry,” says Campbell, whose superhero was inspired, in part, by DC crime-fighter the Green Lantern. “Now I have tons.” His determination has paid off, with sales of 500 copies of his two comics turning the 29-year-old sensitivity trainer at Extend-A-Family into an inspiration for others with physical challenges. “They say, ‘Oh my God, you’re doing this? Maybe I can too!’ ” It’s not about scale or a guest spot on Jimmy Kimmel. None of Espinos’ clients are in it for the money. “Most places will not print anything less than 1,000 copies,” says Campbell’s partner, Jason Louth. The Studiocomix minimum is … “One!” says the affable proprietor. “No, two … (laughs) one goes on the shelf.” Never mind the sales figures. There is a particular satisfaction, insists 16-year-old Xander Wise, in seeing your vision through to completion, to know you’ve created a piece of art, no matter how many copies you sell. “It’s months and months of doing panels and fixing mistakes,” says the self-taught Cambridge resident, who sold 40 copies of his mystical war comic Forgotten Grunt: The Undead Soldier, inspired by the movies Platoon and Apocalypse Now. “But as soon as you do all that work and have that copy in your hands, you realize it’s all been worth it. There have been a few times where I was feeling unmotivated, but as soon as I saw how it turned out I was more than happy.” “If Alfonso wasn’t publishing local comics, I don’t think Xander would be doing what he’s doing,” says Wise’s dad, Darrin. For Espinos, who understands the challenges of ambition without unlimited financial backing, he’s simply filling a market niche. “You gotta start somewhere,” he says matter-of-factly. “Nobody starts out selling 50,000 copies. Every artist has a different definition of success.” Email: jrubinoff@therecord.com\n",

      " Last week, Vancouver’s new city council voted resoundingly to send a letter to the provincial government demanding it repeal the so-called school tax. A more accurate label for the new tax, which is not earmarked for schools but headed for general revenue, would have been a wealth or mansion tax. It hits property-rich homeowners with houses worth more than $3-million. The proceeds will be collected along with Vancouver property and regular school taxes in 2019. \n",
      " Council’s motion is as symbolic as branding Vancouver a nuclear-free zone. There’s nothing council can do except add its voice to the howl coming from residents in Vancouver’s tony West Side neighbourhoods. Some were so incensed when the tax was announced they uncharacteristically hoisted signs and banners at a May protest wearing summer casual shoes nicer than most. Residents in David Eby’s wealthy Point Grey riding are so angry many people think the popular Attorney-General might lose his seat come the next election. \n",
      " Bifurcated property taxes are new to Vancouver, so it is understandable that those hit by the tax feel they are unfair. Some are seniors with little or no income living in homes they bought years ago and feel affronted at being singled out with a school-tax surcharge on top of city property taxes that are going up by 4.5 per cent. They can, of course, defer paying their taxes, but most balk at the idea. However, the tax is popular among vast numbers of British Columbians who can no longer dream of buying a home at today’s inflated prices. \n",
      " Story continues below advertisement. \n",
      " Most of the city council votes broke down as you might expect. Members of the Non-Partisan Association showed their alignment with the provincial Liberals by voting yes. Mayor Kennedy Stewart voted true to his NDP roots and was joined by Christine Boyle and Jean Swanson who are further to the left. And on this occasion, the three Green Party members swung the vote and sided with the NPA against the tax. \n",
      " Green Party councillor Adriane Carr had campaigned against the school surcharge, so her stand was expected. While Vancouverites are confident about where the civic Green Party stands on environmental questions, they are still trying to get the feel for their views on social and economic issues. Will the two newest Green councillors, Pete Fry and Michael Wiebe, be at odds with Ms. Carr, who tends to support the status quo thereby favouring existing property owners? Or will they veer left and take up the charge for renters and those less privileged Vancouverites? Ms. Carr and Mr. Wiebe did not respond to calls on the question. \n",
      " But Mr. Fry, who was stunned by the backlash after he voted in favour of the repeal letter, said in retrospect he feels voting yes was a misstep. He believes there is nothing wrong with charging wealthy people more tax and acknowledges the windfalls made solely by virtue of property ownership. \n",
      " Before the vote, he texted back and forth with his colleague Mr. Wiebe, who also had reservations about voting yes. Ultimately, they decided to side with Ms. Carr, the veteran Green councillor. It wasn’t worth a split, given that with her and all the NPA councillors on side, the vote was destined to win. \n",
      " Mr. Fry says he voted yes to voice his objection to the province meddling in taxes collected by the city and proposed an amendment, which council accepted, to reflect that view. City requests to the province to change the Vancouver Charter are often rebuffed, he says, and he was upset by the provincial incursion onto city turf. \n",
      " He now realizes that is not at all how the public saw it. His social media feed blew up with residents disappointed that he sided with the wealthy. Mr. Fry describes himself as the most left-leaning Green on council. “Why would I pander to the millionaires club?” He now calls it a rookie mistake. \n",
      " For council as a whole, the motion was political gamesmanship, a reflection of political alignments along ideological lines. For the Greens it was a hint of far more challenging decisions to come on issues that don’t fall neatly into their environmental agenda. One of the most interesting things about 2019 will be watching them sort out where they stand. \n",

      " As well as the issues brought up during the online campaign, Traeger​ said he expects the union to help employees negotiate things like scheduling, benefits and how gratuities are paid out. \n",
      " He said unionization is overdue in the restaurant industry, and added he doesn't think customers will mind paying more for a meal if it means restaurant workers are getting paid more and receiving benefits. \n",
      " Three former Stella's Cafe employees behind an online campaign to bring attention to what they call workplace harassment, unfair treatment of staff, racism, and sexual assault at the Winnipeg restaurant chain have outlined what they'd like to see done about their concerns. 2:43. \n",
      " \"Do you want to eat a cheaper dinner off the backs of somebody that's struggling to make ends meet even if they're working as many hours as they can get?\" he said. \n",
      " \"For me, personally, I would rather pay a dollar or two extra at dinner time to make sure that the employees that are working hard to serve my food are taken care of properly.\". \n",
      " The UFCW will represent all servers, dishwashers, cooks, hosts and baristas at the both locations, according to the union's Friday release. \n",
      " Stella's has seven locations in Winnipeg and employs more than 500 people in total. \n",
      " Traeger wouldn't comment when asked if other Stella's locations are considering holding votes on whether or not to join the union. \n",
      " The UFCW is a private-sector union that represents more than 250,000 workers across Canada. \n",
